# Cursor_HW22_Lecture25_DDT

In this project, we created a CSV reader that returns an iterator of objects for reading data from a CSV file and performing a test based on it.
We also created a @DataProvider that returns an iterator of objects from the CSV Reader and passes this data to be checked in our test.
The test receives data from @DataProvider, and checks whether string 1 contains substring 2
